## About Me

I am a full-stack software engineer with 6+ years of experience building scalable and secure web applications across diverse domains. I focus on backend-centric systems complemented by modern frontend architectures to deliver reliable and user-friendly products.

My experience includes API design, authentication and authorization systems (including SSO), and full-stack development using contemporary tools and best practices. In recent projects, I have worked extensively with Vue.js and Inertia.js to deliver seamless SPA-like experiences on top of Laravel, while also adopting other modern full-stack technologies to build performant, production-ready applications.

I also have hands-on experience integrating AI-powered features such as chatbots, automation workflows, and AI agents, and I continuously apply current engineering practices to build future-ready software solutions.
